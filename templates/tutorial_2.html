<h3>HTTP CLIENTS</h3>

<p>
  In the last Tutorial, we explored the web browser making HTTP GET
  requests. We looked at the content of the request and response
  messages, learned about the hidden metadata in HTTP Headers, and how
  to use the web browser's inspector to view details about HTTP
  requests.
</p>

<p>
  However the actual act of making an HTTP request remains somewhat
  nebulous; something that the browser does for us. I will try to show
  you that handling an HTTP transaction is the least impressive thing
  the browser does.
</p>

<h3>TCP AND YOU</h3>

<p>
  A little background on the technology that HTTP uses under the hood:
  TCP/IP. Feel free to skip this if you are familiar with TCP.
</p>

<p>
  HTTP is based on TCP (Transmission Control Protocol). All TCP does
  is let two computers talk over an IP (Internet Protocol) Network. It
  handles slicing huge messages into multiple packets, getting all
  those packets to the other machine, and making sure the packets are
  all there and in order. TCP also checks that each packet does not
  have errors and lets the destination computer tell the source
  computer that a packet needs to be resent.
</p>

<p>
  An open TCP connection is similar to an active phone call: both
  people can hear each other, it is usually a one-on-one call, and if
  anyone can't hear the other person, the misheard speaker can speak
  again. If you have an open TCP connection (called a socket) to
  another computer any data you shove into the open socket comes out
  the other end, and vice versa.
</p>

<h3>BACK TO HTTP</h3>

<p>
  HTTP relies directly on TCP to send its messages and only defines a
  format of what to send. Therefore there is nothing special about a
  browser that lets it send an HTTP message. There are multiple
  browsers that all handle HTTP connections equally well, as well as
  other programs that are not even browsers.
</p>

<h3>ENTER cURL</h3>

<p>
  cURL (Client for URL) is a fairly simple Linux/Unix/etc program for
  making HTTP requests (as well as a plethora of other protocols
  including FTP and even mail protocols).
</p>
<p><em class="tut_action">Run the following command on the command line.</em></p>

<pre><code>curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/tutorial/2</code></pre>

<p>
  You should get a huge blob of text spit out on your terminal. If you
  look through it this is the same HTML for this
  page. <em class="tut_action">(You can verify this if you want by
  hitting CTRL+U (âŒ˜-Option-U on Mac)).</em> All cURL does is spit out
  the body of the HTTP response, be it html, image data, a video,
  whatever.
</p>

<p>
  cURL only showed us the body, but it is sending and receiving
  headers in the HTTP messages too. We can view them by passing the -v
  flag to cURL.
</p>
<p><em class="tut_action">Run the following command on the command line.</em></p>

<pre><code>curl -v http://127.0.0.1:5000/tutorial/2</code></pre>

<p>
  The same blob of HTML will fill your terminal, but at the top is
  something new.
</p>

<pre><code>
    * Hostname was NOT found in DNS cache
    *   Trying 127.0.0.1...
    * Connected to 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1) port 5000 (#0)
    &gt; GET /tutorial/2 HTTP/1.1
    &gt; User-Agent: curl/7.38.0
    &gt; Host: 127.0.0.1:5000
    &gt; Accept: */*
    &gt;
    * HTTP 1.0, assume close after body
    &lt; HTTP/1.0 200 OK
    &lt; Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
    &lt; Content-Length: {somme number of bytes}
    &lt; Server: Werkzeug/0.10.1 Python/3.4.2
    &lt; Date: Wed, 08 Jul 2015 08:22:22 GMT
    &lt;
    A BUNCH OF HTML
</code></pre>

<p>
  All the lines starting with '&gt;' are part of the request data sent
  to the server. All lines starting with '&lt;' are part of the
  response data sent back from the server. Lines starting with '*' are
  just debug messages from cURL and were not in any message.
</p>

<h3>WRAPPING UP HTTP/TCP</h3>
<p>
  Were you up to the task you could write a simple HTTP client or
  server program in C or Python.
</p>

CLIENT:
<ol>
  <li>Open a TCP connection (there are libraries to do this for you).</li>
  <li>Write the request headers to the socket.</li>
  <li>Read back the response from the server.</li>
</ol>
SERVER:
<ol>
  <li>Accept a TCP connection (again there are libraries to do the TCP part of this for us).</li>
  <li>Read the request headers out of the socket.</li>
  <li>Send your response headers and response body back through the socket.</li>
</ol>

<p>
  The machine your program is talking to would not know any better as
  long as you sent the headers correctly. All you would need is some
  error checking and you have a valid and compliant HTTP server or
  client.
</p>

<p>
  Many people try to avoid having to write programs that handle raw
  HTTP connections because they would rather be building a
  website. However some people actually write programs like this, and
  turn them into libraries or frameworks for others to use later.
</p>

<p>
  This webpage, for example, is running on a server written in Python
  called Werkzeug which makes some clever structures in code for
  receiving, parsing, and manipulating HTTP requests, as well as
  generating and sending HTTP responses back down the TCP socket to
  whatever client started the connection.
</p>

<h3>CLOSING</h3>
<p>
  The point of this page was to hammer home that a program being able
  to send and receive HTTP messages is nothing to write home about, as
  well as demonstrate some alternatives to using a browser to open a
  URL.
</p>
<p>
  cURL and similar programs are very useful in debugging or writing
  script to automate your own work, and understanding the basics of
  how to use it, as well as the relatively simple things it is doing
  can be very useful.
